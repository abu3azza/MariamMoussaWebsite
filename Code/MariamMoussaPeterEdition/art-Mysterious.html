              <h2 style="color:#064256">Mysterious/Seductive Relationships …. YES or NO?!</h2>
              <p align="justify"> Be Mysterious! Be seductive! That’s what guys want now right?! You don’t want to risk your relationship, do you?! … Some people would advise you with that! </p>
              <p align="justify"> On the other hand, some people would totally be against being mysterious or seductive in a relationship and maybe even to the extent of judging or categorizing others whom they see are being mysterious or seductive in relationships. </p>
              <p align="justify"> But wait a second, what do YOU want?! How do you feel about being mysterious in a relationship? How do you feel about being seductive in a relationship? </p>
              <p align="justify"> I say you don’t have to take any of these two sides because there is much more to this! </p>
              <p align="justify"> I would like to invite you to an exploration journey with me now. You will only need a pen, paper and most importantly your curiosity to explore yourself deeply and freely in regards to this topic. </p>
              <p align="justify"> You are making a choice right now … Either to grab a piece of paper and go on a discovery journey or just continue reading some words on paper, but your very own relationships remain unchanged. </p>
              <p align="justify"> Only one choice may lead you to your AHA moment, and be your eye-opener. </p>
              <p align="justify"> Well, for all the courageous and curious ladies out there, let’s start the journey of digging in! </p>
              <p align="justify"> Here is how it simply works; you write down, yes write down and not answer mentally, your thoughts about each question before you jump on the next one, holding in your mind that there is no need for any pressures of having the RIGHT ANSWER because what’s right for you is not right for someone else and vice versa. </p>
              <p align="justify">          
              <ul>
                <li> Firstly, in your opinion what does it mean to be mysterious in your relationship? What does it mean to be seductive?</li>
                <li>What keywords have come up here for you now? What about values?</li>
                <li>Who are you BEING? In terms of WHO YOU ARE and NOT WHAT YOU DO. (Characteristics/personality traits and not actions or reactions.)</li>
                <li>Who are you NOT BEING?</li>
                <li>What elements of being mysterious/seductive come easily/naturally for you and what elements don’t?</li>
                <li>Are you mysterious in other areas of your lives?</li>
                <li>What attracts you in being mysterious/seductive in a relationship?</li>
                <li>What repels you in being mysterious/seductive in a relationship?</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p align="justify"> So that’s one side of the coin, however,
              <ul>
                <li>What would guys possibly like/not like about being mysterious/seductive in a relationship?</li>
                <li>Do you think what they are seeking may be satisfied in other ways? If yes, what ways? Which way would you want most?</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p align="justify"> Food for thought: Do mysterious guys exist? Would you want a relationship with a mysterious guy? What would a mysterious guy be like? How does a mysterious guy make you feel? </p>
              <p align="justify"> Now with all your derivatives from above, I would like you to judge for yourself what would work best for you and your partner and what new shifts you would like to implement in your relationships. </p>
              <p align="justify"> In my opinion, there is no one size fits all in relationships, just like there is no one bait used for all types of fishing. When you go fishing, you first clarify what you want to fish for. Are you looking for bass fish, trout fish, shrimps, tuna fish or are you fishing on another scale where you are looking for whales?! Certainly for each, you need a different type of bait to attract your targeted group. That does not mean that the other types of bait do not work, but they just don’t work for your specific target. Well, it’s not just the type of bait, but also the amount of bait used, as it all depends on how much fishing would satisfy you. </p>
              <p align="justify"> So now back to relationships, I would say that being mysterious/seductive in a relationship would, of course, work with some, but not all, guys. It all depends on the guy you are, or wish to be, in a relationship with. </p>
              <p align="justify"> If you look at the below definitions:
              <ul>
                <li>Mysterious: difficult or impossible to understand, explain, or identify.</li>
                <li>Seductive: tempting and attractive; enticing.</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p align="justify"> One person would perceive both words with resonance while another would perceive both of them with dissonance or maybe one of them with resonance and the other with dissonance. That all goes back to your own perception and understanding of the key words in the definition such as difficult, impossible, tempting, etc… and also the values associated with these words. The degree to which you choose to honor the values associated with those keywords will affect your perception of the whole thing and whether such a relationship would work for you or not. Even with that, most likely no two people would have the same implementations of the same perceptions. </p>
              <p align="justify"> So at the end of the day, my tip for you is to understand your own thoughts, perceptions and values and take the decision to choose what suits you best rather than just follow an advice that is most common, but may not be the perfect fit for you. You do not want to buy the most designer gown unless it fits you, and accentuates your best features and physique. </p>
              <p align="justify"> You might tell me fear of rejection or fear of ending up alone would stop you from pursuing what you want but then I would tell you what’s the cost of not being who you want to be?! It only takes courage and knowing the worth of yourselves. </p>
              <p align="justify"> The journey above is just the top layer of knowing yourself more in that area. You could go deeper and deeper and make even more connections to other parts of your life too; but without getting to the first layer, you wouldn’t be able to go deeper. </p>
              <p align="justify"> Share with us your experience on your journey above! </p>
