                <h2 style="color:#064256">Is Doing Good the Best Investment?</h2>
                <p align="justify">
                    Hell yeah! Well, when you do good to others, you do give your money that you have earned through hard work and long working hours, you do give your time that you can never retain, you do give your resources that may be precious, you do give your efforts
                    for someone else whether they appreciate it or not, you do give up opportunities, fun activities and your comfort just to help someone else and you do give up your own interests for the sake of others’ interests; can’t you see how
                    that is the best investment?!</p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Are you a decent analyst who is capable of assessing an investment and its return?! Even if not, you are a wise human being capable of assessing the impact on your own self.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Here are your three options: 1- Do all good for yourself 2- Do some good for yourself and some for others 3- Do all good for others ... which is the best investment?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    You could get out your calculator, your pen and paper if you want to but this time I’m not going to ask you to use these like in the last issue, I’m only going to ask you to bring your WHOLE SELF with you. By that I mean your mind (logic), your heart,
                    your soul and your body; and notice the return of your investment on all these parts.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Here is a situation: A girl that secretly likes a guy with her at work, how does her day look like? She wakes up in the morning, spends at least an hour to make sure she looks her best, goes to the office and says Good morning to everyone but waiting
                    especially for the reply of that guy. She sits down at her desk and every now and then, she takes a peek and sees what is that guy doing? Who is he talking to? When will be the next chance/excuse to talk to him? And suddenly, their
                    eyes meet “coincidentally” and they exchange a swift smile and then return to work. The day ends and she leaves work super excited to call her best friend to tell her that the guy replied to her Good Morning, and smiled at her! Like
                    OMG her day couldn’t be better!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Same exact situation happens but with a different guy that the girl doesn’t see interesting. The girl goes home after work, barely remembers what happened in the morning and it doesn’t consume her thoughts neither positively nor negatively and it’s just
                    another day with nothing special.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What’s the difference here? It’s not anything from the other guys its just her inner emotions, focus, anticipation, perspective and her actions or reactions.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    So does that mean that your own inner initial feelings are somewhat directly related to how you feel at the end?! So what’s more important doing good or the way you do the good?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    And that leaves us with more options to confuse us; well now you can be doing good to others with positive emotions or with negative emotions and both will lead to different returns to your investment (ROIs).
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    So if you choose option 1: your ROI would be more money, more resources, more time, more beauty, etc.… but with also more stress, more worry, more anxiety and a continuous pressure to stay first in the race.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If you choose option 2: your ROI would be more money, resources, time, beauty, etc…. but not that much or maybe you even just maintain the same level but you would still have some stress, worry, anxiety to still keep moving forwards in your race.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If you choose option 3: I can’t really tell you that from my own experience because then I would be a liar as I do not give all for others :D but I could tell you how I see the slope moving and what I hear from others who are much closer to that than
                    I am. And here is what they say: That then real life begins and doing good for others becomes your oxygen! Never been happier or even close, never been satisfied or even close and never been grounded and stress-free as now.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    And with each option, the more you do good for others with positive emotions the better return you get.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If you choose option 2 or 3 then what would doing good for others look like? Is it giving love? Attention? Empathy? Monetary help? Personal help? Time? Care? Appreciation? Noticing? Shelter? A solution to a problem? Or what else?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    How would you look like when doing any of these? Would you come from a superior position? Or would come from a loving, caring and empowering position?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Well they say actions are stronger than words and I say the emotions that accompany your actions are even stronger than your actions.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    The impact of doing good goes far beyond that, for you may see the return on your investments as: happiness, peace, fulfillment, love, etc…, you might also get a ‘smile’, a ‘thank you’, a ‘you are a true blessing’, a ‘prayer’, or even a ‘you saved my
                    life’. Not only but also, you do provide a hidden message through your good works and you do set a role model. The message could be ‘the world is still good’ or ‘you are worthy’ or ‘I want to help you’ or ‘I care for you’ or ‘you are
                    not forgotten’ … And these actually are some of the very basic needs of any human being and the very reasons behind ANYTHING you do… For any man or woman wants to feel worthy, appreciated, noticed, loved, cared for, and supported;
                    even the strongest of people, the wealthiest, the most famous people seek these and feel the hunger for them and no money, no fame, no possession, no success would ever satisfy that or even replace it. For we see people working their
                    whole lives to get a better job, a better house, a better vacation etc… yet they feel lonely, sad, empty and they do finally realize that they have wasted their lives based on lies that were not worthy of.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Here is a benchmark to assess your investment
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    G: Give: What are you giving? What do others want/need?<br/> O: Observe the other, their needs, their emotions, their life as a whole, witnessing, and acknowledging.<br/> O: Observe self: What position are you coming from? What is
                    the impact on you?<br/> D: Drive: What return on investment is driving you?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    So you have the choice now, which investment will you make?
                </p>
