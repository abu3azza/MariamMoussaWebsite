                        ‘Coaching for Managers’ Program, serves as an introductory program, which takes the managers through a coaching experience to allow them to learn how to coach their subordinates. The core foundation of this program is to transfer coaching skills from
                        the coach to the managers through coaching them, reflecting with them and role-playing. It is an interactive and practical process rather than a theoretical one. Through the GROW Model and the Co-Active Model, the program will
                        deliver the 5Ws & H of coaching (what is coaching, when, what, who, why and how to coach), the coaching skills with a focus on the most essential ones, the flow of a coaching session, accountability, measuring the results and the
                        ICF’s coaching ethics.
