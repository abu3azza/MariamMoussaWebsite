                                and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential, which is particularly important in today’s uncertain and complex environment. Coaches honor the client as the expert in his
                                or her life and work and believe every client is creative, resourceful and whole. Standing on this foundation, the coach's responsibility is to:

                                    <li>

                                <br/><br/> The ICF Global Coaching Client Study shows most clients reported improved work performance, better business management, more efficient time management, increased team effectiveness, and more growth and opportunities.
                                The same study found that coaching clients noted greater self-confidence, enhanced relationships, more effective communications skills, better work-and-life balance and an improvement in wellness. Nearly 70 percent of individuals
                                indicated they had at least made back their initial investment. The median suggests that a client who achieved financial benefit from coaching can typically expect a ROI of more than three times the amount spent.
                                <br/><br/> According to the same report, the vast majority of companies (86 percent) say they at least made their investment back. In fact, almost one-fifth (19 percent) saw a ROI of 50 times their investment, while another
                                28 percent saw a ROI of 10 to 49 times the investment. Nearly all companies or individuals who hire a coach are satisfied. According to the ICF Global Coaching Client Study, a stunning 99 percent of people who were polled
                                said they were somewhat or very satisfied with the overall coaching experience.

                            According to the <a href="http://www.coachfederation.org/need/landing.cfm?ItemNumber=978&navItemNumber=567" target="_blank"> ICF</a>,
                            <br/><br/> Professional coaching focuses on setting goals, creating outcomes and managing personal change. Sometimes it’s helpful to understand coaching by distinguishing it from other personal or organizational support professions.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <u>Therapy :</u> Therapy deals with healing pain, dysfunction and conflict within an individual or in relationships. The focus is often on resolving difficulties arising from the past that hamper an individual's emotional
                                    functioning in the present, improving overall psychological functioning, and dealing with the present in more emotionally healthy ways. Coaching, on the other hand, supports personal and professional growth based on
                                    self-initiated change in pursuit of specific actionable outcomes. These outcomes are linked to personal or professional success. Coaching is future focused. While positive feelings/emotions may be a natural outcome
                                    of coaching, the primary focus is on creating actionable strategies for achieving specific goals in one's work or personal life. The emphases in a coaching relationship are on action, accountability, and follow through.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <u>Consulting : </u>Individuals or organizations retain consultants for their expertise. While consulting approaches vary widely, the assumption is the consultant will diagnose problems and prescribe and, sometimes,
                                    implement solutions. With coaching, the assumption is that individuals or teams are capable of generating their own solutions, with the coach supplying supportive, discovery-based approaches and frameworks.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <u>Mentoring :</u> A mentor is an expert who provides wisdom and guidance based on his or her own experience. Mentoring may include advising, counseling and coaching. The coaching process does not include advising or
                                    counseling, and focuses instead on individuals or groups setting and reaching their own objectives.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <u>Training :</u> Training programs are based on objectives set out by the trainer or instructor. Though objectives are clarified in the coaching process, they are set by the individual or team being coached, with guidance
                                    provided by the coach. Training also assumes a linear learning path that coincides with an established curriculum. Coaching is less linear without a set curriculum.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <u>Athletic Development :</u> Though sports metaphors are often used, professional coaching is different from sports coaching. The athletic coach is often seen as an expert who guides and directs the behavior of individuals
                                    or teams based on his or her greater experience and knowledge. Professional coaches possess these qualities, but their experience and knowledge of the individual or team determines the direction. Additionally, professional
                                    coaching, unlike athletic development, does not focus on behaviors that are being executed poorly or incorrectly. Instead, the focus is on identifying opportunity for development based on individual strengths and capabilities.

                            and credibility of the coaching profession by bridging science and best coaching practices. The IOC advances research by awarding $100,000 a year in Harnisch Grants for coaching research projects.
                            <br/<br/> CTI joined forces with the IOC in June 2012 to bring the art and practice of coaching together with the science that supports its efficacy. As a benefit of this partnership, CTI students and graduates are eligible
                            for a discounted membership to the IOC’s global coaching community, the Institute of Coaching Professional Association (ICPA). This association brings together professionals and leaders in the field to disseminate coaching
