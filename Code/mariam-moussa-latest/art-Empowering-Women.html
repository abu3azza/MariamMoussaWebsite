                    What is Empowering Women for you? What’s the importance of Empowering Women? Who do you want Empowered Women to become?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    The most empowered woman is the woman who can fully perform the roles of a woman in her best way. It’s to empower a woman to become her fullest potential and grow into her magnificence and not into a certain image set by others or by the society. Up until
                    here, I think we would all agree but when it comes to what are the roles of a woman is where there are so many perspectives that are influenced by Societies, Bringing Up, Norms, Cultures and even Religions. Disregarding that point
                    of conflict, no matter what the role is, these are significant keys to empower women by, starting now!
                </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li> Witness Her
                            <ul>
                                <li style="list-style-type:none">
                                    <p align="justify">See her! She exists and she has an impact! She’s not only a body but she has a soul, a spirit, a mind and a heart too! See her by giving her a voice, a responsibility, a task or even simply trust! See her unique identity
                                        and not the general collective view of women. Witnessing has to do more with you, your thoughts, your eyes, your choices and not her.</p>

                                        her characteristics. Acknowledge every single detail. Acknowledging doesn’t necessarily mean agree but rather it’s simply noticing and expressing your understanding and appreciation.</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Any woman wants to know, feel and believe that she CAN. Sincerely believe in her. Sincerely tell her that she can because of one, two and three. Sincerely tell her that things will be possible even if it takes ages
                                        of efforts, perseverance and determination. Show her WHY you truly think she CAN. Challenge her and Cheer for her! </p>

                                    <p align="justify">Many people think of support as something to DO; but sometimes support is someone to BE and not necessarily something to DO. Check with her what’s her need and feed that. Don’t assume that what she needs is what you
                                        would need in her place or what you think should be the case. That way you will be giving her all the support she needs!</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Love is an emotion, an action, a word and a gesture. Love heals. Love strengthens. Love sets free. Love accepts. Love gives. And Love makes you ALIVE!</p>

                                        it’s important for her. Listening is not necessary for you to take an action afterwards but sometimes its all she needs. By listening you send her so many messages and the impact is marvelous!</p>

                                    <p align="justify">Understand what is unspoken, unexpressed and unmentioned. There is so much under and in-between the words. It’s not a riddle or a mission impossible to solve. To do that, all you need is to notice the tone of voice,
                                        the body language, the emotion, the energy, the body posture, and the actions that complement the words. Understand her values, interests and cares. Understand WHO she IS and not just WHAT she DOES or SAYS.</p>
