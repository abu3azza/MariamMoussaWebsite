                <p align="justify">
                    Do people say that wild is crazy?! Do people say that wild is being outside of the box?! Do people say that wild is not who you are supposed to be?!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    NO and NO and NOOO! … Wild is who YOU TRULY ARE!!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Where has your mind taken you right now, were you imagining your wildness?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Did you see your WILD DREAMS? Did you see your WILD OUTINGS? TRIPS? HOBBIES? IDEAS FOR A BUSINESS?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Why do you see these as WILD? Is it because they are different? Against the norm? Against culture? Not many are doing it or maybe even none?! Is it because its out of the box and probably resisted by others? Or is it because it thrills you? Fires up your
                    adrenaline? Makes you feel special? And fulfills you?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    You are right and have every right to want to feel wild; for that is the very nature you have been created with. If you go back in time, there wouldn’t be any systems, cultures, norms, judgments and career paths; nothing but the laws of nature. These
                    all evolved by time, whether because of greed, seeking power, wisdom, wealth or by the desire to feel right or good about yourself or even an attempt to make everyone live a “better” life supposedly. Peers, cultures, societies, and
                    definitely the media have been placing pressures to tame or direct you to certain things or beings!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If you look at wild animals whether on land or in waters, you will see that wild means animals living in the natural state without any intervention. If you look at wild plants, you will see them as the plants grown naturally without a planter other than
                    nature. So what does a WILD human being look like?!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If you were WILD, not tamed, not trained and not influenced, who would YOU BE? What would you LOOK LIKE? What will you DO? What will you SAY? How will you LIVE YOUR LIFE differently?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    YOU are created with UNIQUENESS, with EXCLUSIVE GIFTS, and with a PURPOSE You are not created to be a clone or to be lesser than who you are, just because of anyone or anything that tries to tame you or shape you in order to constrain you into a certain
                    box or path!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    It’s time to be YOUR WILD SELF! Don’t live inside the box, don’t live outside the box but live with NO BOX at all! Get rid of all the cages and chains that try to make you just like everyone else because you are not! And that does not mean to go doing
                    anything and everything, anywhere and at anytime. It does not mean to go nuts and it doesn’t mean to loose your morals and ethics, or to overpass boundaries and freedoms for even the forests have natural boundaries and rules. It just
                    means to be YOURSELF! Be your own character. Be your own thoughts. Be your own perspective.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    I’ll use the career as an example just because its very common these days to hear ‘I hate my job’, ‘I feel drained’, ‘My week is 5 days work and 2 days recovery’, ‘I wish I could have a passionate job’ or ‘It’s only Monday and I can’t wait for the weekend’.
                    The only good thing about this, is that it creates a reason to drink coffee which raises the revenues for the coffee sector but other than that, it has killed the aliveness and the wildness in people. So be the singer you have always
                    wanted to be because you are gifted with that talent. See how could you use your singing for a purpose? Be the fashion designer, be the animal caregiver, be the instrument player, be the artist, be the engineer, be the scientist, be
                    the researcher, be the athlete, be the event organizer, be the writer, be the film director. Be whoever you want to be! Be WILD!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Be wild in your career! Be wild in your hobbies! Be wild in your recreations! And most importantly Be wild in your personality and character! Find your uniqueness, talents and gifts and BE WILD! Use your wildness to make a change, to transform and to
                    inspire! Live life to the fullest and your fulfillment will come only from your WILD PURPOSE not from being like everyone else!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    There are many organizations around the world now trying to preserve life in the wild and trying to set tamed and captive animals back into the wild. Don’t you think it’s time to set HUMANITY into its original wildness again?!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    It all starts now … it’s your choice, the door of the cage is wide open, WILL YOU GO OUT AND BE WILD?!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If your answer is YES, then the first step is actually to be wild and SHARE this perspective with others and that’s not for marketing reasons but because the tamed version wouldn’t share this because of FEAR OF JUDGEMENT!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    #BeWild #BeYou is how it’s meant to be! WILD is NATURAL !!!
