                        LIFE TUNING is a one-month program that combines “Personality Analysis” with “Life Coaching”. The formula for the program is simple but effective:
                        <p class="margin20" align="center"><i>
“Personality Awareness + Individual Coaching = Steps Towards Healthier, More Productive Lives”
</i></p>
                        The program is a collaborative work between the Certified Personal & Professional Coach, Mariam Moussa, CPCC, ACC and the MBTI Certified Practitioner, Karim El-Shammaa; who have come together with the same vision of using their skilled expertise in order
                        to empower, transform, and develop personalities to their fullest potential.
                        <br/><br/> LIFE TUNING is composed of:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Group Sessions: To create space for awareness of individual differences between people through activities and discussions</li>
                            <li>Individual Sessions: To receive customized coaching and create personal life action plans</li>
                            <li>Written Exercises: To give you room for guided personal reflection</li>
                            <li>Personality Readings: To give you deeper understanding of your personality’s dynamics</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/><br/> LIFE TUNING isn't just a workshop or a program that you will attend, it is a journey and a life-changing experience where you will be discovering yourself, understanding others, connecting with your inner jewels, being
                        vulnerable in service of growth, being conscious and intentional in your choices, and building inspiring relationships with the whole group during the program.
                        <br/><br/> The personality assessment that will be taught in this course is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the most globally popular personality assessment with businesses and individuals.
                        <br/><br/> The coaching model used in the program is the Co-Active Model.
