                <p align="justify">
                    If you would compare yourself today and who you are right now to the different Egyptians along the history, whom would you closely be similar to?</p>
                <p align="justify">
                    History isn’t my area of expertise honestly and luckily for you, I’m not going to be talking about the History of Egypt but let’s have a look of the development of the Egyptian throughout the years till today!</p>
                <p align="justify">
                    With no surprise, we start with the pharaohs’ era. That’s kind of the first edition or the original version of how an Egyptian looked like. So what did they look like?</p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Of course, they weren’t all the same, for you have kings, farmers and those in between. You also have unique characteristics of each individual but there are certain things that classify the whole population collectively. For even now, you know how the
                    British are different than the Germans, different than the Americans, and different than the Arabs. Even within the Arabs, you can differentiate between the Lebanese, the Saudis and the Egyptians. </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    So without further due, what made the Pharaohs, the Pharaohs? Values usually tell a lot about people. Achievements, accomplishments and the way they were achieved also speak about them. Another thing is their relationships, in the sense of types, quantities
                    and qualities of their relationships. So what do you think were the main characteristics of the Pharaohs? Characteristics that made them a benchmark even till this day! Characteristics that made them able to build the pyramids with
                    no technology and just hours of hard work and teamwork! Characteristics that enabled them to create not follow or imitate and not even just develop! What values did they have? What did they mostly care about? Was it others or themselves?
                    Was it the now or the future? Was it me or us? The ways they built their cities and houses were to influence what type of relationships? Closed or open? Constructive or destructive? Unity or division?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    In my opinion, I could see lots of “We can!”, “We will!”, “Together”, “Why not?”, “Great work!” and “You make a difference!”. No one individual could have done the pyramids alone, they could not have done it if they were trying to each shine separately
                    and definitely they would have not done it without loving each other and caring for each other! Of course, during such a huge project, there were obstacles, disagreements, negotiations on how to do things and different opinions for
                    they were people but they had to look at the ultimate purpose, the bigger picture to be able to surpass all of that!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    From the times of the Pharaohs till today, there were many other eras. With each having its significance, its achievements and its values. Many other times along history, Egypt was leading in a certain market, a certain product or a certain talent or
                    else we wouldn’t have been a lust in the eyes of other countries. What happened to us now? Who are we now? Do we look like we come from this line of ancestors?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What happened along the way? What do we value today? What made us who we are today? Was it our circumstances or us?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What is leading us now? I personally believe that phrases such as “We can!”, “We will!”, “Together”, “Why not?”, “Great work!” and “You make a difference!” are very rare nowadays or maybe they are said but not meant and so do not have the same impact
                    or effect. Our values have changed; our relationships have been reallocated to technologies or materialism and our purpose is completely different. We only see ourselves not our colleagues, not our partners, not our friends, not even
                    our families and definitely not the society as a whole whom are strangers to us! And what’s the result of that?! We hate who we have become, we hate our country’s progress and we hate the way things are done. We complain, we accept
                    that we are from the third world and we all long to leave the country from the richest to the poorest of us! We changed from a country and a population who the whole world desires, to a country where its own population wants to leave
                    it.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    I am not going to discuss or blame or argue what caused this or when did it happen. For it happened and we can’t change the past but we have the future! What I urge YOU and I to do TODAY is to CHOOSE! Choose who do you WANT to BE! And I am not saying
                    who are you in relative to the above, I am saying who do you want to be, because YOU ARE AT CHOICE! The only reason I would recommend to look at the past is to learn from, learn what to do and what not to do. Learn what to care about
                    and value, and what not to care about nor value and don’t just be theoretical about it. Think practically what do you really need to do or think differently in order to be whom you choose to be! Shouldn’t the up to date version be
                    better than the original?! I know it’s kind of hard to compete with the amazing pharaohs but it only takes a decision to choose, then with determination, hard work and a spirit of love, we can and we will if we choose!
