                    What comes to your mind when you hear the word contradiction?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    I asked some friends this question and here are some of their common answers: something & its opposite, differences in opinions, problems, when actions are opposite to the beliefs, and incompetency between what you want & what you get.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    How do you feel right now after reading these? Did you notice how all the answers were kind of heavy or limiting?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Well, have a look at the next question;
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What’s your current perspective on contradictions?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Here are some of their answers too: confusing, sometimes right & sometimes not, and frustrating.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What do you notice now? Dissonance? Contradicting answers?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What do you think is behind contradictions in general? Would you say perspectives? Would you say facts? Would you say purpose? Or is it a combination?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What usually happens when a contradiction takes place? Disagreements? Break-ups? Discontinuation?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    And here comes the big question!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    CAN CONTRADICTIONS COMPLEMENT?
                    <br/><br/> ……… think again about your answer,<br/> ……… again,<br/> ……… and again.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What do you think now? What does that mean?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What would it look like if you would see contradictions as an opportunity instead of a barrier or a limitation or a problem raiser?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    And by that I mean, that each time you are in a situation with another person who has a different opinion, instead of holding to yours and trying to convince the other, you would try to understand the other perspective or maybe even come up with a third
                    collaborative perspective than joins looking at the same box from all sides. So instead of seeing each other standing at opposing sides, you would see both of you standing beside each other trying to find the win-win perspective or
                    the collaborative perspective.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    And each time you discover that a person’s actions are opposite to their beliefs, instead of judging and categorizing, you would try to understand what has led that person to do that and actually work on helping that person to be less contradicting in
                    that sense. That does not mean, to go around and tell others how they should act, react or change but rather provide them with the deepest need from a loving & caring perspective, that is leading them to do so; that might be love,
                    attention, care, understanding, supporting, encouragement or even a welcoming environment that is clear of any judgments.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    How about contradicting partners in any relationship?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If you think of that with the earliest perspective … I think that relationship would be hell! It would probably be full of conflicts, distrust, judging and not smooth in any way. But does ‘opposites attract’ ring a bell? Would such a relationship even
                    have a chance to sustain? If no, then why not? If yes, under what conditions would it sustain?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    What would that even look like?!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    In my opinion, yes opposites do attract and that is naturally explained by: we always tend to want what we don’t have, but for how long can both sides of the relationship stand that?! And if you look carefully, all relationships will contradict to a certain
                    extent or at a certain point of time for no two people are exactly the same! An extremely contradicting relationship has the possibility to work out just like any other and could be one of the greatest relationships as it would be
                    collaborating many different traits BUT, and I repeat BUT, if it only holds some conditions with it. Below are the bare minimums in my opinion.
