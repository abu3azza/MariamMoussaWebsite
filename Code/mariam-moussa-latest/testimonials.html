                    <p>
                        Coaching helped me to know more how to deal with my problems. I think it gave me more self-confidence and it helped me as if Iâ€™m talking to myself, and what are the questions to ask; it helps to go deep inside my thinking. It is trying to get out what
                        is inside.</p>

                    <p>
                        To start with; I was a hesitant person that was unable to make decisions for my own self as I was hesitant about my capabilities, and by time I was becoming more hesitant and I hated this about myself given that I was never that hesitant in my life before.
                        <br/><br/> I had an idea of the reason behind this new problem that appeared in my life but I was also afraid as well as unable to face this problem alone or in other words I needed or preferred to feel safe and have someone to
                        help me go through fixing this problem.
                        <br/><br/> By a pure coincidence I knew that someone I know and trust a lot does this coaching thing. I asked about the process and pricing and was glad it was all suitable for me.
                        <br/><br/> I took the decision to be as open as I can, to get the best outcome as I was really upset with the hesitant and weak personality I had at the time.
                        <br/><br/> I started the 6-months course. I followed even the tiniest recommendation, comment; I did any assignment I was asked to do even the permanent ones that I practice until this moment.
                        <br/><br/> Finally, I am very comfortable, confident and happy with the personality I have at the moment and I know that I would have never reached it without external help and also personal effort and contribution.
                        <br/><br/> I definitely recommend coaching for any early stage of any possible personality deformation not only serious cases.
                        <br/><br/> I was also glad to find a Christian coach who had the extra option of relating any situation and finding its solution according to the Christian beliefs.
                        <br/><br/> The results of my personality changes were noticed by my close friends and family members and I received compliments about my progress and I was very surprised as I thought I am doing this progress for my own self development
                        and had no idea it could be apparent to others as well.</p>
