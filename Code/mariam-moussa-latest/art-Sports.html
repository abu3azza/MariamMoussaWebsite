                <p align="justify">
                    When would you say that something is dangerous? When something is at the verge of being lost, damaged or depleted?
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Let’s have a look at sports. It surely doesn’t seem to be threatening your life in any way but it is actually advised by many doctors to play sports as part of the cure or as a preventive method to many diseases!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    But Yes! Sports is actually dangerous for you! How?! So the process of playing sports begins by you starting to think one of the following: I want to loose weight or I want to look fit or I want to feel healthy. You then start exploring the different
                    sports or just choose a certain sport and go for it. You practice, practice, practice and maybe even enter some tournaments or championships, of which you win some and loose others. You attain the results you desired at the beginning
                    and probably that might or might not encourage you to do more sports until you feel enough! When is enough? That all depends on your choice!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    The process isn’t that direct or smooth of course, but that’s the overall trend.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Up until now, nothing seems dangerous but rather inspiring to urge you to play sports. Here’s the DANGER: Sports THREATENS your fats, diseases, laziness, your laying back, your demotivation, your stagnancy in your place, your unchanging, your unwillingness,
                    your comfort zone, your negative thoughts, your doubts about your abilities, your weaknesses, your obstacles and WHO YOU ARE BEING TODAY! ALL OF THAT WILL BE THREATENED, DEMOLISHED, TRAINED AND SUBSTITUTED!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    ARE YOU WILLING TO LOOSE ALL OF THAT?! Just to play sports and become stronger, fitter, healthier, and A BETTER YOU TOMORROW?!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If you said NO, then congratulations sports will not be dangerous for you; but if you said YES, well a BIGGER CONGRATULATIONS for you because you have just decided to become the better person you have longed to become!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    If you said NO, then congratulations sports will not be dangerous for you; but if you said YES, well a BIGGER CONGRATULATIONS for you because you have just decided to become the better person you have longed to become!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    So luckily sports does that to your health; wouldn’t it be great to have something do that to your whole life and not just your health?!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    COACHING! Yes, coaching can and will threaten parts of you to get you WHERE YOU WANT TO BE and WHO YOU WANT TO BECOME!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Coaching is a process that will challenge your thoughts, perspectives, emotions, comfort zone, habits and the story you tell yourself about yourself in order to empower you to become the most magnificent version of yourself. Taking charge of your life
                    and consciously choosing the journey you want to travel and how you want to travel it.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    The route or journey you take in coaching will differ from anyone else’s as what suits you would differ from what suits others but the impact or the results of coaching remain the same. You will feel lost at times, struggling at other times and even demotivated
                    sometimes but that won’t last long! With every session in the coaching process you either become more aware of yourself, your values, your habits and trends, and the story you tell yourself about yourself or you may acquire new perspectives!
                    You’re always faced with the truth but in an empowering and safe environment that enables you to use any energy, pressure or lesson as a fuel to move forwards and become transformed into your fullest potential. I’m sure you all came
                    across the famous metaphor that illustrates transformation at its best; where the caterpillar transforms into the butterfly! Well, the coaching process enables you to go through that transformation in the most empowered and beautiful
                    way!
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    Coaching isn’t for everyone though; it’s for the winners who are willing to fall if necessary in order to stand up stronger, bigger and more beautiful! It takes work but it’s definitely worth it and you won’t just feel it inside of you but people around
                    you will notice it about you! You would be living purposefully and honoring your values.
                </p>
                <p align="justify">
                    So how would your life look differently if you played sports? What would you loose? What about if you had some coaching? Who would you be? What would you be doing? How would you feel? What would be possible? What would you be standing up for? How would
                    coaching be dangerous for you? What traits, habits or thoughts will be threatened?
                </p>
