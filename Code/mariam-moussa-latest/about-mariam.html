                                Page, I was attracted by the posts, which made me interested to try a free session, I liked it and so I started. In coaching, I realized that it's all about critical thinking, having a pause and thinking, taking sometime
                                for thinking, it changes your life, performance and productivity. Coaching will let you see things that are in front of you but you don't see them, and you will realize your values. My coach Mariam is really an excellent
                                coach; I consider her as a friend, she is professional and supportive. As an engineer; I like coaching as it uses a logical way of thinking, which is most comfortable for me. My advise to anyone is to try a free session
                                after that you will be able to judge and realize the difference. <i class="fa fa-quote-right" style="color:#ffba00"></i> </h4>
